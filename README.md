# Dotfiles
These are Dotfiles that I use on/for my systems :)

### These are configuration/dotfiles that are currently in this repository
  - i3       (Window-Tiling-Manager)
  - bspwm    (Window-Tiling-Manager)
  - NixOS    (OS)



You can find the initial path of files easily,
just by looking at the folders name.

And if you have any questions or problems please submit it :D .



You can install, modify and use it. 

Have a nice day :)
