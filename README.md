# Dotfiles

This repository contains All of my Configuration Files for various Machines, as well as Operating Systems, Distributions, Desktop Environments and Window Tiling Managers.


## Directories - Walkthrough 

- **pc** - intended for Configuration Files of my "general" systems (e.g. pc/laptop). Here you can find Configuration Files for various Distributions (e.g. NixOS, Gentoo's compiler, Window Tiling Manager configs, cli tools configurations, ...)
- **server** - stores Configuration Files for my Server Machines. These can be Container setup data Files (e.g. podman, docker, ...), or it can also be Generic Configuration of the system. I currently run NixOS on my server. You will be able to find Configuration Files for it too.


### Notes

Inside Directories you will find Configuration Files. Sometimes I will also include Images for better visualization, and README.md files, where short information about how it functions and what it does will be contained.
