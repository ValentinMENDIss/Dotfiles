# BSPWM-DOTFILES


### Light and Easy to use

Btw, if you want tp you can modify it :)


## Information

I use this config files for bspwm window tiling manager
on my second PC that has linux arch installed.

This config files were made with help of some videos that are free
to watch on youtube and anyone can find. Some things were a little
modified, so it suits my needs best. 


## How To Install?? 

To install you can run my script "install.sh" that is in config folder,
or you can also install it manually if you want to :)

Right now the script is made only for Debian/Ubuntu Based Distributions, 
but later I will rewrite install scrip to be working on a lot of other Distributions

### Don't Forget!!!
Don't forget that in some folders there are laptop or pc versions of config files. Choose one and move/copy it in your needed folder
(example: ~/.config/.../...)
