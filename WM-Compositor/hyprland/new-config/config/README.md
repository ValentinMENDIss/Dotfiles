# Dotfiles of my Hyprland configuration

These are my dotfiles of the hyprland configuration I use on my machine.

# Packages

Here are some packages that you will need to install in order for this configuration to function properly:

- kitty         (terminal)
- swww          (wallpaper)
- waybar        (bar on the top of the screen)
- dunst         (notificiation daemon)              ( you don't really need to install that, but if you want to you can :3 )
- wofi          (launcher/menu program)
- hypridle      (idle status of machine/turn off display after x seconds)
- hyprlock      (lockscreen)
