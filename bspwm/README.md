Btw, if you want you can modify it :)


## Information

I use this config files for bspwm window tiling manager
on my second PC that has linux arch installed.

This config files were made with help of some videos that are free
to watch on youtube and anyone can find. Some things were a little
modified, so it suits my needs best.
